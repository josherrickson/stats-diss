I would like to thank my Advisor, Ben Hansen, for all his assistance and support. I would also like to thank the entire Statistics department: the
faculty, fellow students and all the support staff; as well as all others across the university whom I have interacted with over the years. Finally I
would like to thank my wife for her patience.
